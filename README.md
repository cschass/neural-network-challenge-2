# neural-network-challenge-2
Module 19 Challenge

In this challenge the student was required to import the following dependencies:
- from sklearn.model_selection import train_test_split
- from sklearn.preprocessing import StandardScaler
- import pandas as pd
- import numpy as np
- from tensorflow.keras.models import Model
- from tensorflow.keras import layers

Next the student needs to import and read the csv fild and determine the number of unique values in each column.

Create a Y dataframe using the Attrition and Department columns. Pick 10 columns of the students choice and create a X dataframe and print the data types.

Slit the data into the training and testing data sets. The student checked to see if there were any missing values and then converted the values to a numeric data type. The student then checked to ensure the data types had been converted.

Student needs to Scale and fit the training data using the Standardscaler, preprocess the data with OneHotEncoder and create 2 new variables.

Part 2 of the assignment is to create, complie and Train the model. The model should include a branch for the deparment and a branch for the attrition.

Lastly, the student will need to evaluate the date and answer the 3 questions as defined in the assignment.
